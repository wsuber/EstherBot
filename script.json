    "QQQZXDFG": "Twilio- 14438927057  heroku- will-bot.herokuapp.com   smooch- wills other bot FB- Will's Bot",
    "DISTANCE": "Distance is equal to (Vi*t)+ 1/2(at^2)\n Be careful! Make sure you remember that the acceleration is negative when youre throwing an object up into the air! Also, if the object starts at rest, dropped, or thrown horizontally, d=1/2at^2",
    "DISPLACEMENT": "Distance is equal to (Vi*t)+ 1/2(at^2)\n Be careful! Make sure you remember that the acceleration is negative when youre throwing an object up into the air! Also, if the object starts at rest, dropped, or thrown horizontally, d=1/2at^2",
    "ACCELERATION": "a=change in V/t\n a= net force/mass. This equation is Newton's Second Law. F=ma!",
    "FINAL VELOCITY": "Vf=Vi+at\nVf^2=vi^2+2ad.\n Remember that these are FINAL SPEEDS/VELOCITIES, not averages. ",
    "FORCE OF FRICTION":"Ff = (Coefficient of friction)(Normal Force) REMEMBER: The Normal force is only m*g when the object is on a lavel surface",
    "FORCE DUE TO GRAVITY": "Fg= (G*m1*m2)/r^2   The radius is simply how far away the center of the two objects are. ***Inverse square***",
    "NORMAL FORCE": "Fn = m*g For an object on a level surface. If the item is on an incline, the normal force is equal to the vertical component of the gravitational force!",
    "ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY": "g=Fg/m",
    "MOMENTUM": "Momentum is represented by p. p=mv and the (p Before) = (p After) a collision",
    "IMPULSE": "Impulse is shown using the letter J. J=Fnet*t  OR J= change in momentum (delta p). To find the net force, make sure you use Newton's second law F=ma",
    "MAX FORCE ON A SPRING": "Fs=kx  THIS IS NOT THE AVERAGE FORCE, RATHER THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FORCE IT TAKES TO COMPRESS A SPRING. Also, the spring constant, k has units of n/m",
    "POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SPRING": "PEs=1/2kx^2. This can be set equal to the amount of work it takes to compress a spring, or the kinetic energy of a spring after it is released. Also, the spring constant, k, has units of n/m",
    "CENTRIPITAL FORCE": "Fc= m(cent. acceleration) or  Fc= (mv^2)/r\n look familiar? It's just Newtons second law!",
    "CENTRIPITAL ACCELERTION": "a= v^2/r",
    "POTENTIAL ENERGY": "PE= mgh    Remeber that work is equal to the change in an object's energy... Sometimes these are interchangable!",
    "KINETIC ENERGY": "KE= 1/2mv^2  Since KE is basically the energy of motion, it makes sense that the velocity is squared, also remeber that work is equal to the change in an object's energy... Sometimes these are interchangable! ",
    "WORK": "W=Fd or the change in an objects energy! Therefore, the amount of work done on an object is simply how much its energy changed.",
    "POWER": "P=W/t  P=Fd/t   P= Fv (This uses the average velocity/speed) Power is the rate at which energy is expended",
    "AVERAGE VELOCITY": "v=d/t  If you need velocity, make sure you use the total displacement, NOT distance!!",
    "CONNECT ME": "",
    "DISCONNECT": "Roger that, Physics-Bot is back."
